# bikeshare

A data analysis program written in python to explore and analyse bikeshare data across 3 cities in the United States

## Instructions

csv files are saved into the data folder for tidyness. if this is not done, the program will fail when the csv file cannot be loaded by pandas. If files are kept in the same directory as the bikeshare_2.py file then modify the function call on line 281 to remove the "data/" argument and it will default back to searching in same diretory
