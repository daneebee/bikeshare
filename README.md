# Bikeshare

A data analysis program written in python to explore and analyse bikeshare data across 3 cities in the United States.

## Instructions

csv files are saved into the data folder for tidyness. if this is not done, the program will fail when the csv file cannot be loaded by pandas. If files are kept in the same directory as the bikeshare_2.py file then modify the function call (load_data()) on line 306 to remove the "data/" argument and it will default back to searching in same diretory.

## Features

* View data by three different cities (Chicago, Washington, New York city)
* Get various stats for bikeshare data for each of the 3 cities
* View the raw data in 5 row chunks
